Padding is often used in convolutional layers to control the output size and preserve information at the edges. In certain CNN architectures like LeNet, AlexNet, and VGGNet, both stride and padding values are fixed for each layer type and cannot be modified.\n\n(2) Pooling layer The pooling layer, or sub-sampling layer, reduces the number of weights parameters by down sampling, optimizing computational efficiency and mitigating overfitting.\n\n(3) Fully connected layer Finally, the fully connected layer, or classification layer, processes the extracted features and performs classification.

    "Context": "The image shows various activation functions used in neural networks, including sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, linear/identity, ReLU, leaky ReLU, and ELU, each with its unique mathematical representation and application in machine learning models.\n\nBatch Size\n\nIn mini-batch gradient descent, learning is performed by calculating the loss function for each batch. When the batch size approaches the size of the entire dataset, it behaves similarly to one-batch gradient descent, which updates the entire dataset at once. This makes it robust to outliers but weak against local minima. Conversely, when the batch size is closer to 1, the updates become more like stochastic gradient descent, making it less resistant to outliers but better at escaping local minima. By adjusting the batch size, we can balance between outlier resistance and the ability to overcome the local minima problem.\n\nOptimization algorithm\n\n(1) Gradient Descent with Momentum\n\nWeights are updated in a way similar to the concept of inertia, where an object tends to continue moving in the same direction. The closer the Momentum coefficient is to 1, the more it maintains the current direction, while values which are closer to 0 approach standard gradient descent. When the Momentum coefficient is 1, a new gradient is added without changing the current direction. Conversely, if the Momentum coefficient is 0, it is identical to regular gradient descent.\n\n(2) Adagrad\n\nFor variables that fluctuate significantly during training, we reduce the learning rate. For instance, if one variable is updated more frequently than a no ther, its learning rate is adjusted accordingly.\n\n(3) RMSProp\n\nAdagrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually, but it can get stuck with a very low learning rate due to accumulating past gradients. RMSprop addresses this by giving more weight to recent gradients, preventing the learning rate from becoming too small too quickly.\n\n(4) ADAM\n\nAdam is a learning method that combines the stren g ths of momentum and RMSprop. Momentum helps maintain the direction of movement, while RMSprop reduces the learning rate for frequently updated variables. Adam uses two hyperparameters beta1 and beta2. The closer the Beta1 value is to 1, like the momentum coefficient, the more it maintains the direction in which the gradient value is moving. The Beta2 value is a ratio that maintains the size of the gradient before the current point, similar to the gamma value of RMSProp. The closer the Beta2 value is to 1, the greater the influence of reducing the current learning strength due to the previous update time.",

It includes a Context Layer, which serves as a memory component, retaining information about previous states. The Context Layer has the same number of nodes as the hidden layer and stores the hidden layer's state values through recurrent feedback. By using the influence of independent variables from previous time points, Elman N et predicts the dependent variable at each time point.
