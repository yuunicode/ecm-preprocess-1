The one is 2-Level Factorial Design and the other is the General Full Factorial Design. 2-Level Factorial Design refers to an experiment with 2-level factors. However, even if each factor has two level values, if the experiment is performed at all grid points, (n is the number of factors) experiments must be performed. Therefore, 2-Level Factorial Design provides a way to reduce the number of such experiments to suit your purposes. There are three types of 2-Level Factorial Design provided by ECMiner™ as follows.2 n\n\n2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators)\n\n2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators)\n\nPlackett-Burman Design\n\nECMiner™ provides the General Full Factorial Design, which is convenient when the number of levels for each factor is different. In this experiment, because the experiment is performed at all grid points, the significance level of all interactions can be determined.\n\n6.1.3.1.1. 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators)\n\n2-level fractional design (default generators) are used for full factorial and fractional factorial design.\nSelect 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators) as follows.\n[image:rId15]\n\n[Table:t63]\n\n[Image:rId15] The image is a screenshot of the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, a data mining software tool.

The chart helps in determining the optimal number of experiments needed to explore all possible combinations of factors at different levels.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\nSelect fractional factorial design or full factorial design. Set the number of center points, the number of setup repetitions, and number of blocks.\n\nNumber of Center Points: Assume a linear relationship between factors and the response in a 2-level factorial design. Add center points to test for non-linear (curved) relationships. Set the center points to the midpoint of each factor in a 2-level factorial design.\n\nFor example:\n\n-Factor A: Low = 50, High = 100 Center = 75. →\n\n-Factor B: Low = 10, High = 20 Center = 15. →\n\n-Number of Replicates: Calculate the amount of pure error by repeating the same experiment.\n\n-Number of blocks: Set blocks in factorial design.

See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\n[image:rId29]\n\n[Image:rId29] The image is a screenshot of the \"Plot and Response Optimizer\" tab in ECMiner, a data mining software tool. It allows users to visualize factor effects, interactions, and response surfaces using plots like contour and surface plots. The main purpose is to optimize responses by analyzing how different factors affect outcomes through various graphical\n\nIn Step 5, there are various types of charts. In response optimizer, an optimization algorithm is performed to obtain the response value desired by the user. The following are the plots by 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators).\n\nMain Effect Plot\n\nInteraction Plot\n\nSurface Plot\n\nContour Plot\n\nFor the main effect plot and interaction plot, first select whether to use the data average or the fitted average. And through the Setting button, you can select which factors to plot for.\n\nFor a surface plot and contour plot, you must enter a fixed value for one or more factors when there are three or more factors. Here's an example screen you'll get after making these settings.\n\n[Table:t124]\n\n[Image:rId32] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a surface plot with three tabs: Main Effect Plot_y1, Interaction Plot_y1, and Surface Plot_y1. The plot visualizes the relationship between variables y1 and x1, highlighting interactions and main effects in a 3D space.\n\n[Image:rId33] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a Contour Plot for a response surface analysis. It visualizes the relationship between Reaction Temperature and Response Time, with different colors representing various levels of the response variable. The plot helps identify optimal conditions for maximizing the response value.\n\n[Image:rId30] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a graph with three lines representing different variables: response time, temperature, and amount of ingredients. The graph illustrates how these variables affect a specific metric, likely in a data mining context, with each line showing a trend or relationship between the variables.\n\n[Image:rId31] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying graphs for response time under different reaction temperatures and ingredient levels. The graphs illustrate how response time varies with changes in reaction temperature and ingredients, highlighting interactions between these factors.\n\nResponse Optimizer helps identify the combination of factor settings that optimize the response. First, select the response variable to optimize and enter objective, lower limit, target value, upper limit, weight, and importance in the following settings window.\n\n[image:rId34]\n\n[Image:rId34] The Response Optimizer settings in ECMiner allow users to define response variables, set target values, limits, weights, and importance for optimization objectives. The screen shows how different objective functions influence the shape of the desirability function, with options to minimize, achieve, or maximize fitness within specified ranges.\n\nIn the option window of the Response Optimizer, enter the initial value setting method and various settings used for optimization, and then click the View Results button on the main screen in Step 5 to obtain the following screen.\n\n[image:rId35]\n\n[Image:rId35] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using a 2-Level Factorial Design in ECMiner, focusing on optimizing response time with factors like reaction temperature and ingredient amount. The table lists various combinations and their corresponding overall desirability scores, indicating that all combinations yield the same optimal response.\n\nFrom the above process, you can find out how to determine the level of each factor (Response Time, Response Temperature, Amount) in order to maximize the response value (yield). (At this time, the level of each factor is displayed in coded units.)\n\n6.1.3.1.2. 2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators)\n\n2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators) allows to manually define and create a custom factorial design by specifying its factors, levels, and interactions.\nThis design works when the default designs (e.g., full factorial or fractional factorial) are not appropriate for a specific experimental with specific factor combinations or constraints.\nSelect 2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators).\n[image:rId36]\nStep 1, enter the number of factors before increasing the design using the design generators. In the above setting, the number of factors is set to 2. Step 2 screen is as follows.\n[image:rId37]\nClick the Constructor Design to increase number of factors and complete the part corresponding to the design generators. You can enter block generators depending on your experiment. For example, if you want to increase the number of factors using the generator C=AB, enter C as the left term and AB as the right term as shown above and click the next button.\n[image:rId38]\n[image:rId39]\nYou can see that one more column corresponding to factor C has been created, and the value of this column is the same as the product of the value in Column A and the value in Column B. In this way, you can create design tables using different generators depending on your needs. The analysis process after this is the same as that of 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators).\n\n[Image:rId36] The image is a screenshot of the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, a data mining software tool. It allows users to choose between various experimental planning methods such as 2-Level Factorial Design, Response Surface Design, Mixture Design, and Taguchi Design. The primary purpose is to facilitate the\n\n[Image:rId37] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users specify options for completing a design table. It displays a full factorial design with 4 factors, 1 center point, and 1 replicate, suitable for analyzing interactions between factors.\n\n[Image:rId38] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users specify options for completing a design table. It displays a full factorial design with 4 factors at two levels each, complete resolution, k(2) p(0), and one replicate. The interface allows for specifying center points and block\n\n[Image:rId39] The image is a screenshot of the Design Table in ECMiner DOE, which is used to input experimental design data for analysis. The table shows factors, levels, standard order of points, block numbers, and response values for each point type. This setup helps in planning experiments and analyzing outcomes efficiently.\n\n6.1.3.1.3. Plackett-Burman Design\n\nThis design is used when the number of factors is large. This design can be used when the user has prior knowledge that the only one factor the response value is the main effect. This prior knowledge helps to dramatically reduce the number of experiments.\nPlackett-Burman design has similar post-analysis steps to 2-Level Factorial Design. Therefore, we will mainly explain the differences compared to 2-Level Factorial Design.\nThe characteristic of Plackett-Burman is that it dramatically reduces the number of experiments when the experimenter knows in advance that there is only a linear relationship between factors and response values. For example, the main effect can be detected with just 48 experiments for 47 factors. The reason we use the Plackett-Burman design is that it can dramatically reduce the need for experimentation.\nSelect Plackett-Burman design and select 20 factors on the Step 1 screen. Step 2 Afterwards, if you move to the Step 2 screen, you can select the following number of experiments.\n[image:rId40]\nIf the experimenter aims to minimize the number of experiments, a design with 24 runs can be selected. The maximum number of runs can be selected up to 48, but 48 experiments for 20 is not particularly burdensome. Set the number of runs and the number of center points and repetition according to your purpose. Center point is used to check curvature, and by increasing repetition, pure error can be checked how much the difference in response value occurs at the same experimental point.\nIn Step 3, the design table is completed, and in Step 4, the following screen appears.\n[image:rId41]\nIn the Plackett-Burman design, interactions other than the main effect cannot be detected. If you select a factor and proceed with analysis, the subsequent process is the same as 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators).\n\n[Image:rId40] The image shows the \"Design\" tab in ECMinerDOE, where users specify options for completing a design table, including the number of runs (24) and repetitions (28, 36, 40). The checkbox allows designation of a block for repetition.\n\n[Image:rId41] The image shows the Analysis Result tab in ECMinerDOE, where users can configure settings for statistical analysis. It allows selecting a response variable (y1) and available factors, with options to start the analysis.\n\n6.1.3.1.4. General Full Factorial Design\n\nGeneral Full Factorial Design overcomes the limitation that the previous three designs (2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators), 2-Level Factorial Design (Specified Generators), and Plackett-Burman Design) can only conduct 2-level experiments. DOE is capable of. The level of each factor can have any value. For example, when the number of factors is 3, the number of levels can be 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In General, Full Factorial Design, all possible combinations are tested, so if the number of levels is 2, 3, or 4, you will get the following design table.\nThe following is a Full Factorial Design\n\n[Table:t172]\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\n[image:rId42]\n\n[Image:rId42] The image is a screenshot of the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, a data mining software tool. It allows users to specify factors, their levels, and response values for analysis. The current setup includes three factors (A, B, C) with two, three, and four levels respectively, and\n\nIf there are three factors (A, B, C) that can have values of 2-Level, 3-Level, and 4-Level, respectively, enter the setting values as above.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId43]\n\n[Image:rId43] The image is a screenshot of the \"Design\" tab in ECMiner DOE software, where users specify options to complete the design table for factorial experiments. The user has set the number of repetitions to 1 and selected to designate a block for repetition. This setup is crucial for conducting statistical analysis and optimizing experimental designs efficiently\n\nIn Design Selection window you determine the number of repetitions and whether you want to assign blocks to repetitions.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId44]\n\n[Image:rId44] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) window where users can complete a design table, enter response values, and analyze results for optimizing experimental outcomes. The table displays experiment orders, point types, blocks, factor levels, and corresponding response values for various factors A, B, C, and y1\n\nAfter the table is created, enter the response value y1 and click the Next button to proceed to Step 4.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\n[image:rId45]\n\n[Image:rId45] The image shows the Analysis Result page in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis. It allows selecting a response variable (y1), choosing available factors, setting the highest-order interaction to 3, and starting the analysis.\n\nSet the Highest-order interaction to 3 and start the analysis. When you start analysis after completing settings, the following results screen will appear.\n\n[image:rId46]\n\n[Image:rId46] The image shows an ANOVA table for response value y1 in ECMiner, analyzing variability in terms A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, and ABC. The table provides statistical measures like df, Mean Sum of Square, F, and p-values to assess model fit and significance.\n\nGeneral Info, residual analysis and interpretation of other information are the same as 2-Level Factorial Design (Default Generators). The ANOVA table shows that the variance increases significantly when the degree of interaction is high. In this case, it is difficult to explain the response value with only the individual effects of A, B, and C, and the response value y1 is determined by complex effects.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nMain effect plot and interaction plot. (Surface plot, contour plot, and response optimizer functions are not provided.) Main effect plot and interaction plot, shows how the value y1 reacts according to each level of the factor.\n\n[image:rId47]\n\n[Image:rId47] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a graph with three lines representing different variables (A, B, C) over a range of values. The graph illustrates the main effect plot for variable y1, showing how each variable affects the outcome.\n\n[image:rId48]\n\n[Image:rId48] The image shows output results from ECMiner, displaying two plots: Main Effect Plot_y1 and Interaction Plot_y1. The Main Effect Plot_y1 illustrates how different levels of factor A affect variable A, while the Interaction Plot_y1 shows the interaction between factors A and B on variable B.",

    "Context": "This content is about the section Extension, and more specifically it belongs to DOE, under the subsection DOE Method s, with a detailed reference to Central Composite Design.\n\nFor a quadratic regression model with k number of independent variables,\n\ny= β0 + i=1 k β i x i + i≤j k β ij x i x j +ϵ ϵ~N(0, σ2)\n\nthe regression coefficient cannot be estimated using the 2-Level factor placement method. Because in a 2-level factorial experiment, the experiment is conducted only at two levels of each variable, it is not possible to detect the curved change in the response amount that occurs according to the change in the level of the variable, and it is impossible to estimate the coefficient of the square term in the quadratic regression model. In order to compensate for these shortcomings and estimate the curved surface with a small number of experiments, the DOE in which the center point and axis point are added to the 2-Level factor experiment as follows is called Central Composite Design.\nIn Central Composite Design, the number of center points is not limited and can be at least one, and the number of axis points is 2k. Here, the value of k can be a positive number. For example, if the factor is 3 and there are two central points, the central composite design in Full factorial design is as follows.\n[image:rId49]\nLines 1 to 8 are experiments on grid points. And lines 9 to 14 are the axis points. And the last two rows are the center points. This will result in a design that can sufficiently estimate the regression equation for the quadratic curve. This type of experimental design has the advantage of being able to find the regression equation for the quadratic curve with a much smaller number of experiments than 3-Level Factorial Design.\nThe number of experiments in this experiment is\n\n[Image:rId49] The image shows a matrix in ECMiner, a data mining tool, with a focus on its structure and potential applications in pattern recognition or feature selection. The matrix is symmetric and contains alternating positive and negative values, which could represent weights or coefficients in a machine learning model.\n\nn= 2 k +2 k+ n0, n0 is a number of center points.\n\nAn advantage of Central Composite Design is its flexibility for sequential experiments. For instance, if a 2-Level Factorial Design with a first-order regression model proves inadequate, additional design points can be added to the center and axes to convert it into a Central Composite Design, without having to start a new DOE.\nSelect Central Composite Design from Response Surface Design.\n[image:rId50]\n\n[Table:t226]\n\n[Image:rId50] The image is a screenshot of the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner data mining software, where users can choose between Factorial Design, Central Composite Design, Box-Behnken Design, and Taguchi Design for experimental planning.

Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nIn this step, you can draw a surface plot and contour plot with the Regression Model created in Step 4 and optimize the response according to the user's purpose. Since there are currently two factors, there is no need to enter a separate fixed value. The surface plot and contour plot according to each response value are as follows.\n\nSurface plot, contour plot for response value “Adhesion”\n\n[Table:t297]\n\n[Image:rId72] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a 3D surface plot with three axes representing adhesion, modulus, and elongation values.

The plots illustrate how different amounts of V130 and G300 affect these properties, with color-coded regions indicating varying levels of adhesion, modulus, and elongation.\n\nIn this experiment, the experimenter's goal is to maximize the modulus value over 145, the elongation value over 388, and the adhesion value. To do this, set the following settings.\n\n[image:rId78]\n\n[Image:rId78] The Response Optimizer settings in ECMiner allow users to define response variables, their objectives (minimize, maximize, or achieve), target values, limits, weights, and importance for each variable. The screen shows three graphs illustrating how different weightings affect the desirability function for each objective.\n\nIn the window above, the target values of modulus and elongation are set to 145 and 388, it means that there is no need to increase the values any more, once these values are reached. And the reason why the target value of adhesion was set as large as possible is because in the case of adhesion, the larger the better. (In fact, it seems reasonable to set the lower limit of modulus and elongation to 145 and 388. However, in this case, if the modulus value is less than 145 or the elongation value is less than 388, the desirability function becomes 0. In fact, this area is so large that it is often difficult to find the optimal value when performing optimization. For this purpose, the performance of optimization was improved by setting the lower limit a little smaller.)\n\nAfter configuring this and performing optimization, you can get the following results.\n\n[image:rId79]\n\n[Image:rId79] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Response Surface Design with Central Composite Design in ECMiner. It displays coded units for response optimization, including G300 Amount, V130 Amount, adhesion, modulus, elongation, and Overall Desirability. The results indicate that the optimized\n\nFrom this, we can see that if the G300 content is -1.414 and the V130 content is 0.211, the adhesion can be maximized to 73.652 while satisfying the conditions of modulus and elongation.\n\n6.1.3.2.2. Box-Behnken Design\n\nBox Behnken's design was created to complement the shortcomings of 2-Level design and 3-Level design. In general, p-level designs are suitable for polynomial fits of order p-1. Therefore, it is difficult to fit a second order polynomial with a 2-level design, and although it is possible with a 3-level design, it has the disadvantage of requiring a large number of experiments. Box Behnken's design is an experiment that selects a part of the 3-level design and allows for more efficient second order polynomial fit.\nBox Behnken design is also a design created for the same purpose as central composite design. Therefore, rather than explaining this in detail with an example, we will explain the differences in central composite design. (For basic methods of Response Surface Design, please refer to 6.1.3.2.2. Central composite design.)\nSelect Box Behnken Design from Response Surface Design. In the Step 1 screen, enter the number of factors, factor name, and upper and lower limits, and enter the number of response values and names according to the response value.\nThe screen for Step 2 is as follows.\n[image:rId80]\nAs shown, simply select the options, and the subsequent process will be the same as central composite design.\n\n[Image:rId80] The image is a screenshot of the \"Design\" tab in ECMinerDOE, a data mining software tool. It allows users to specify design parameters such as center point count, repetition count, and block count for conducting experiments or analyses. The default settings are shown, with options to either use predefined values or user\n\n6.1.3.2.3. Response Surface Design D Optimal Design\n\nD-Optimal Design is a method that adjusts the experimental design to best suit future statistical analysis, allowing customization based on the user's needs. There are the following indicators to judge the excellence of design.",

To explain this, the experimental design using only the mixture components can be explained using Simplex Center Design, the mixture amount design can be explained using Simplex Lattice Design, and the experiment adding process variables can be explained using Vertex Design. Through this, you can gain a general understanding of Mixture Design.\n\n6.1.3.3.1. Simplex Center Design\n\nSimplex Center Design, which consists of q components, consists of d ifferent experimental points. These points correspond to all possible permutations. This design can be said to be suitable for the following polynomial.2 q -1\n\nη= 1 q β i x i + i<j q β ij x i x j + i<j<k q β ijk x i x j x k +…+ β12…q x1 x2 … x q\n\nFrom this, we can see that as the number of components increases, the degree of the appropriate polynomial also increases.\nTo perform Simplex Center Design, select Mixture Design -> Simplex Center Design on the following screen.\n[image:rId82]\n\n[Table:t382]\n\n[Image:rId82] The image is a screenshot of the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, a data mining software. It allows users to choose between various experimental planning methods such as Factorial Design, Response Surface Design, Mixture Design, and Taguchi Design. The highlighted option is \"Simplex Center Design,\" indicating\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\n[image:rId83]\n\n[Image:rId83] The image is a screenshot of the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, a data mining software tool. It shows settings for feature selection with three components A, B, and C, each having a lower limit of 0 and an upper limit of 1. The response variable Y1 is selected,\n\nIn this screen, the number of components is 3, the number of response values is 1, and the name of the response value is firmness. The options that appear on this screen are explained as follows.\n\n-Single Total: Specifies the sum of each component. The default value is 1.\n\n-Multiple Total: Enter the values for the mixture amount design. All values must be positive numbers and should be separated by spaces.\n\n-Add Process Variable: Use when adding a Process Variable to Mixture Design.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId84]\n\n[Image:rId84] The image is a screenshot of the Design tab in ECMinerDOE, which is used to specify options for completing a design table. It allows users to expand designs by adding axis points and set repetition settings for different point types such as Axis Points, Center Point, Vertex, and 2-mixed. The iteration\n\nOn this screen, set several options to confirm the design.\n\nExpand Design by Adding Axis Points\n\nAdds axis points between the center point and the points corresponding to each vertex.\n\nRepetition Setting\n\n-Specify Iteration Count for Entire Design: Specify how many times to repeat the design table created through this option.\n\n-Specify Iteration Count for Selected Design Point: This option allows the user to set the number of repetitions depending on the point type.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId85]\n\n[Image:rId85] The image is a screenshot of the Design Table in ECMiner DOE, which is used to complete a design table for a factorial experiment. The table includes factors, levels, standard order of points, block numbers, and response values for each point. The goal is to analyze the impact of different factors on the response variable\n\nAt this stage, the design table is completed, and the experimenter conducts the experiment according to the created table and inputs the resulting response values. This completes everything you need for analysis. Click the Next button to proceed to Step 4.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\n[image:rId86]\n\n[Image:rId86] The image shows a simplex chart in ECMiner, a data mining tool, displaying three vertices labeled A, B, and C. The chart represents a simplex optimization problem where points within the triangle represent different combinations of variables A, B, and C. The goal is to find the optimal combination that maximizes or minim\n\nBefore making analysis-related settings, you can use the Simplex Design plot to see how the design points created in the design table are arranged. The simplex design plot above shows that the points are evenly spaced\n\n[image:rId87]\n\n[Image:rId87] The image shows the Analysis Result page in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis. It allows selecting a response variable 'y1', choosing available factors like A, B, C, and their interactions, setting the highest-order interaction to 'Special 3rd Order', and specifying model type as\n\nSet the model in the main screen of Step 4 and start the analysis. This allows regression analysis, analysis of variance, and residual analysis. If you made a prediction on the main screen in Step 4, you can also see the predicted value.\n\nGeneral Info: Shows general information about the design.\n\nModel Info: View results of regression analysis, ANOVA, and unusual observations (extreme leverage, standardized residuals).\n\n[image:rId88]\n\n[Image:rId88] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Mixture Design with Simplex Center Design in ECMiner. It presents estimated coefficients for response value y1, including terms like A, B, C, and their interactions, along with standard errors, t-values, and p-values to assess statistical significance. The\n\nRegression analysis and analysis of variance shows that the model has high suitability, and residual analysis below shows that the normality assumption is reasonable.\n\nResidual-related plots: View residual histograms, residual normal probability plots, residuals versus ordinal, and residuals versus fitted values.\n\n[Table:t423]\n\n[Image:rId90] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a residual vs. z-value plot with red dots representing residuals and a linear trend line. The plot is used to evaluate model fit by comparing observed residuals against expected values, ensuring that the model's assumptions about the relationship between variables are met.\n\n[Image:rId91] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a residual vs. fitted values plot for model y1. It visualizes residuals on the y-axis against predicted values on the x-axis, with red residuals, UCL and LCL lines, and a guide line. The plot helps assess model fit and\n\n[Image:rId92] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a residual plot with various lines indicating control limits and a guide line. The plot compares residuals against run numbers, helping to assess model fit and identify potential outliers.\n\n[Image:rId89] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a residual histogram for model y1. It visualizes residuals across different ranges, indicating the distribution and variability in the model's predictions compared to actual values.\n\nOther Information\n\nShows residual related statistics.\n\n[image:rId93]\n\n[Image:rId93] The image shows the output results for an Experimental Design using a Mixture Design with a Simplex Center Design, specifically focusing on fitted values and residuals for response value y1. It provides detailed statistical information about each order's fitted value, residual, standardized residual, external standardized residual, leverage, distance of Cook, and DF\n\nFor detailed explanation, see 6.1.4. See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nThrough Step 5 of Mixture Design, you can view surface plots and contour plots, and perform response optimizer tailored to the user's purpose. Below are the surface plot and contour plot for the Regression Model created in Step 4.\n\n[Table:t432]\n\n[Image:rId95] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a contour plot with three variables A, B, and C. The plot visualizes the relationship between these variables, likely for optimization purposes, with different colors representing varying values of a dependent variable y1.\n\n[Image:rId94] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a surface plot with three variables A, B, and C, and a dependent variable y1. The plot illustrates how y1 changes across different combinations of A and B, with C fixed at 1.00. The data points form a smooth\n\nIf the purpose of this experiment is to know which combination of ingredients maximizes the response value (firmness), enter the following in the setting window. Setting the lower limit at -1 means that any response value below -1 is considered equally 'not good.' The target value is set at a very large value, such as 1000, to indicate that we want to maximize the response value as much as possible.\n\n[image:rId96]\n\n[Image:rId96] The Response Optimizer settings in ECMiner allow users to specify the target value, lower limit, upper limit, weight, and importance for a response variable. The screen also displays graphs illustrating how different objective functions (minimize, achieve, maximize) influence the shape of the desirability function.\n\nAfter making the settings as above and completing the simple option settings, click View Results and you will get the following results.\n\n[image:rId97]\n\n[Image:rId97] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using a Simplex Center Design in ECMiner, focusing on Response Optimizer for mixture design. It presents three runs with varying values of A, B, and C, along with their corresponding y1 values and overall desirability scores.\n\nIn other words, through response optimizer, it can be seen that the firmness value increases to 6.52244 when component A is 0.00044, component B is 0.00104, and component C is 0.99853. The experimenter checks whether the firmness value increases to a satisfactory level in this combination of components. You can end the experiment or resume the experiment.\n\n6.1.3.3.2. Simplex Lattice Design\n\nIf the goal is to conduct an experiment in a simplex region and create a regression model based on the experiment results, it would be desirable for the experiment points to be evenly distributed throughout the simplex region. The design that meets this purpose is Simplex Lattice Design. Simplex Lattice Design is a useful design for fitting m-order polynomials when there are n components.\nThrough Simplex Lattice Design, we will explain mixture volume design. First, select Simplex Lattice Design.\n[image:rId98]\n\n[Table:t445]\n\n[Image:rId98] The image is a screenshot of the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, a data mining software. It allows users to choose between different experimental planning methods such as Factorial Design, Response Surface Design, Mixture Design, and Taguchi Design. The highlighted option is \"Simplex Lattice Design,\"\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\n[image:rId99]\n\n[Image:rId99] The image is a screenshot of the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, a data mining software tool. It shows settings for feature selection with three components (A, B, C) each having lower and upper limits set to 0 and 1 respectively. The response variable is selected as Y1,\n\nIn this step, we set up the basic settings for the ingredients used in the experiment. Since this experiment is a mixture amount design, multiple total amounts are selected rather than a single total. If you think the quantity will have a quadratic or greater impact on the response value, experiment with three or more positive values. If you are sure that the quantity will have a linear effect on the response value, two quantity values are sufficient. This requires careful consideration because the smaller the number of positive values, the fewer the number of experiments.\n\nHowever, as a result of the analysis of the first experiment conducted in this way, if it is confirmed that the effect of the amount of mixture is quadratic or higher, there is no need to perform the experiment perfectly from the beginning, as you only need to do a few additional experiments. After completing the settings, click the Next button to proceed to the next screen.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId100]\n\n[Image:rId100] The image is a screenshot of the Design tab in ECMinerDOE, which is used to specify options for completing a design table. It allows users to expand designs by adding center points and axis points, with repetition settings for iteration counts. The table shows different point types: Axis Points, Center Point, Vertex,\n\nIn this step, several detailed options are set to complete the design.\n\nGrid: It is very important how you select this grid because the degree of model that can be suitable is determined depending on the grid. If you want to do the first fit, you need to set the grid to 1 or higher, and if you want to do the second fit, you need to set the grid to 2 or more. Since the current composition is expected to have a secondary effect on the strength of the metal, the grid is set to 3 to allow some margin. (As the number of Grids increases, the number of experiments increases, so be sure to keep this in mind when choosing options.)\n\nFor repeat settings, it is the same as Simplex Center Design.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId101]\n\n[Image:rId101] The image is a screenshot of the Design Table in ECMiner DOE, which is used to complete a design table for data mining purposes. The table includes factors, levels, standard order of points, block numbers, and response values for analysis. The user can edit added response variables and choose between Standard Order of Design or\n\nThrough Step 3, the Design Table is completed, and the experimenter performs the experiment according to the given Design Table and then inputs the response value (strength). After completing your input, click the Next button to proceed to the analysis step.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\n[image:rId102] In Step 4, you can select Mixture Quantity Experiment in Model Type. If mixture components are selected, even if the amounts are different, if the proportions are the same, they are considered the same and analyzed. However, since it is clear that the actual experiment given here is one that requires consideration of the amount of mixture, we choose the experiment of amount of mixture. The maximum order of the term to be included and the maximum order of both terms of the mixture to be included are set to quadratic and linear, respectively, and terms that are known in advance to have no effect are removed as above. (Alternatively, it is a good idea to analyze by including all possible terms and then look at the analysis results and remove terms that are deemed meaningless.) The analysis details are 6.1.3.3.1. Please refer to Simplex Center Design.\n\n[Image:rId102] The image shows the Analysis Result page in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis. It selects 'y1' as the response variable, lists available factors like A*B*Amount, A*C*Amount, B*C*Amount, and selected factors such as A, B, C, A\n\nHowever, the Regression Model created above has the following form.\n\ny= b1 x1 + b2 x2 + b3 x3 + b12 x1 x2 + b13 x1 x3 + b23 x2 x3 + b1,Amount x1 Amount-A + b2, Amount Amount-A + b3, Amount Amount-A\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nIn this step, the regression model created in Step 4 is expressed as a surface plot and contour plot, and a response optimizer function is provided to meet the experimenter's purpose. When the amount of mixture is 2, the plot looks like this.\n\n[Table:t475]\n\n[Image:rId103] The image shows an output result from ECMiner, displaying a surface plot with three variables A, B, and C, where the y-axis represents the output value. The plot illustrates how the output changes as the values of A and B vary within their respective ranges.\n\n[Image:rId104] The image shows a Contour Plot generated by ECMiner, displaying the relationship between variables A, B, and C on a surface plot. The plot illustrates how different combinations of these variables affect a dependent variable y, with color gradients indicating varying values.\n\nThe experimenter's goal is to maximize the response value (strength), so the goal is maximization and the lower limit and target values are entered as appropriate values. Again, for the same reason as in most examples, we set the lower limit to -1 and the upper limit to 1000.\n\n[image:rId105]\n\n[Image:rId105] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using a Simplex Lattice Design in ECMiner, focusing on Response Optimizer analysis. It presents three runs with varying values for A, B, C, and their corresponding y1 and overall desirability scores.\n\nFrom the above results, we can see that the maximum strength of the metal can be obtained at (A, B, C) = 3*(0, 0, 1).\n\n6.1.3.3.3. Vertex Design\n\nVertex Design refers to finding the vertices of the Convex Set that satisfy the upper and lower limit conditions and linear constraints when these conditions are added, augmenting the experiment with these vertices, and then performing experiments on these points. Intuitively, we can see that when there are only upper and lower limit conditions and linear constraints in an n-dimensional space, it is not an easy process to find the vertices of the space created by these conditions. Therefore, this cannot be obtained through a simple process, but Piepel (1988) presented an algorithm to obtain these vertices.\nWe will explain how to add process variables to Mixture Design through Vertex Design.\nFirst, select Vertex Design.\n[image:rId106]\n\n[Table:t486]\n\n[Image:rId106] The image is a screenshot of the \"Select Experimental Design Method\" window in ECMiner, a data mining software tool. It allows users to choose between different experimental planning methods such as Factorial Design, Response Surface Design, Mixture Design, and Taguchi Design. The highlighted option is \"Vertex Design,\" indicating that\n\nStep 1: Factors and Levels\n\nFirst, add a process variable by selecting the Add Process Variable checkbox. Then click Setting button to view the pop-up window as shown below.\n\n[image:rId107]\n\n[Image:rId107] The image shows the \"Process Variables\" window in ECMiner, where users can select one process variable (X1) with a range from 100 to 200. The design type is set to \"Full Factorial,\" indicating a full factorial experiment with one section number. This setup is likely\n\nThen, enter the constraints for the ingredients in the main screen of Step 1 and click the Next button.\n\n[image:rId108]\n\n[Image:rId108] The image is a screenshot of the \"Factors and Levels\" tab in ECMiner, a data mining software tool. It shows settings for feature selection with three components A, B, and C, each having specified lower and upper limits. The user has set a single total value of 1.0 and plans to\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId109]\n\n[Image:rId109] The image is a screenshot of the Design tab in ECMinerDOE, which is used to specify options for completing a design table. It allows users to expand designs by adding center points and axis points, with a repetition setting that specifies one iteration count for the entire design. The table lists different point types: Axis\n\nSeveral options can be specified in the Design selection step.\n\nDesign order: Take the current vertex and decide to what degree the point should be augmented.\n\nExpand Design by Adding Center Point: Determine whether to add a center point\n\nExpand Design by Adding Axis Points: Determine whether to add an axis point, which is the midpoint between the center point and each vertex\n\nRepetition Setting\n\n-Specify iteration Count for Entire Design: Specifies how many times to repeat the same entire experiment\n\n-Specify iteration Count for Selected Design Point: Depending on the type of point, the number of repetitions varies.\n\nStep 3: Design Table\n\n[image:rId110]\n\n[Image:rId110] The image shows an ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiment) window where users can complete a design table, enter response values, and analyze results for optimization purposes. The table includes factors A, B, C, X1, and Y1 with various point types, blocks, and levels. Users can edit added response\n\nAt the Design Table stage, a Design Table is created, the experimenter conducts an experiment according to the created design, and then inputs the response values. After completing the input, click the Next button to proceed to Step 4.\n\nStep 4: Analysis Result\n\nBefore starting Analysis Result, check how the design points created through the current algorithm are distributed in space through a Simplex Design plot.\n\n[image:rId111]\n\n[Image:rId111] The image is a simplex chart generated by ECMiner, displaying a set of data points in a triangular coordinate system. The chart shows how different combinations of variables A, B, and C affect the outcome, with each point representing a unique combination of values. The chart helps visualize relationships between these variables and identify patterns or\n\nAlthough the arrangement of the design points is not triangular due to the limiting conditions, they are arranged evenly in the limited space.\n\n[image:rId112]\n\n[Image:rId112] The image shows the Analysis Result page in ECMiner DOE software, where users configure settings for statistical analysis. It allows selecting response variables, available factors, and interaction levels, with options to add process variables and start the analysis.\n\nFor Model Type, select Add process variable and enter the maximum order of terms to include and the maximum order of the process variable terms to be included as required. Then you can get the following result:\n\nGeneral Info: Provides basic information about design.\n\nModel Info: Provides information on regression, analysis of variance, and unusual observations (extreme leverage, standardized residuals).\n\n[image:rId113]\n\n[Image:rId113] The image shows the output results of an experimental design using a vertex design in ECMiner, focusing on the analysis of response values y1. It presents estimated coefficients for various terms, including A, B, C, and their interactions with other factors, along with standard errors, t-values, and p-values to assess\n\nResidual related (residual histogram, residual normal probability plot, residual vs. ordered, residual vs. fitted Value)\n\n[Table:t528]\n\n[Image:rId117] The image shows the output results of ECMiner, specifically a residual plot for model evaluation. It plots residuals against run number, with red dots representing residuals, black lines indicating guide lines, and pink lines showing control limits (UCL and LCL). The plot helps assess model fit and identify potential outliers or patterns in\n\n[Image:rId114] The image shows the output results of ECMiner, specifically focusing on the residual histogram for model y1. It displays residuals grouped into intervals, with each interval represented by a colored bar. The histogram helps assess the goodness of fit for the model, indicating how well the predicted values match the actual data points.\n\n[Image:rId115] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a residual vs. fitted values plot with a linear trend line. The red points represent residuals, indicating the difference between observed and predicted values, while the green line represents the fitted model. This plot helps assess the goodness of fit and identify any patterns or outliers\n\n[Image:rId116] The image shows an output results screen from ECMiner, displaying a residual vs. fitted values plot with various lines indicating different confidence intervals and residual categories.

The table provides detailed information about each order's fitted value, residual, standardized residual, external standardized residual, leverage, distance of Cook\n\nFor more information, see 6.4. See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\nIn the Step 5, it shows what the Regression Model created in Step 4 looks like through surface plots and contour plots.\n\n[Table:t537]\n\n[Image:rId119] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a surface plot with three variables A, B, and C, where the y-axis represents the output value. The plot illustrates how the output changes based on variations in A and B, with point A indicating the highest output value.\n\n[Image:rId120] The image shows an output results window from ECMiner, displaying a Surface Plot with three variables A, B, and C. The plot visualizes the relationship between these variables, with values ranging from 0 to 1. The highlighted area indicates the optimal region for maximizing the response variable y1.\n\nResponse optimizer is performed according to the experimenter's objectives. The goal of the current experiment is to maximize quality, so if the goal is maximized and the optimization is performed with the lower limit and target value as -1 and 1000, respectively, the following results can be obtained.\n\n[image:rId121]\n\n[Image:rId121] The image shows the output results of an Experimental Design using Mixture Design and Vertex Design in ECMiner, focusing on Response Optimizer. It presents three sets of parameters (A, B, C) for different experimental runs, along with their corresponding X1 values, y1 values, and overall desirability scores\n\nIn other words, you can see that the maximum quality of 36.05873 can be obtained when Components (A, B, C) = (0.5, 0, 0.5) and Process Variable = 1 (working temperature = 100 degrees).\n\n6.1.3.3.4. Mixture Design and D Optimal Design\n\nMixture Design and D Optimal Design is a method that optimizes the design for the best process (e.g., food ingredients, chemical blends, or formulations). D-Optimal Mixture Design combines the principles of mixture designs and D-optimality to create an efficient experimental plan for mixture experiments.",

In Taguchi's experimental design, this is evaluated using the SNR. In other words, the Taguchi experiment plan finds the optimal experiment combination that can reach the operator's desired conditions in an experiment environment that includes noise. Additionally, the number of experiments is dramatically reduced through the use of orthogonal array tables.\nIn addition to the above features, the Taguchi design has many advantages. The Taguchi method provided by ECMiner TM DOE is as follows:\n\n2- Level Design\n\n3- Level Design\n\n4- Level Design\n\n5- Level Design\n\nMix-Level Design\n\n6.1.3.4.1. 2- Level Design\n\n2-Level Design is a design used when there are two levels per factor.

Users can also select three\n\nSelect 7 factors and select 3 as the number of response values. In this case, the number of response values 3 means three types of roads.\n\nStep 2: Design\n\n[image:rId126]\n\n[Image:rId126] The image is from the ECMiner DOE (Design of Experiments) module, showing design selection options for specifying experiment counts in factorial designs with 2-level factors.

As a result of the analysis, you can obtain a variance analysis table along with the SN ratio Factors with a negligible small SS can be excluded from the initial experiment. Since the SS of E is substantially large, this factor is considered a decisive factor in the SN ratio of CO.\n\nFor a detailed explanation, see 6.1.4. See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\n[image:rId129] At this stage, the optimal conditions can be found through the main effects plot for the SN ratio. Since a larger SN ratio is better, the optimal conditions are A2, B2, C1, D2, E2, F1, and G2.\n\n[Image:rId129] The image shows an output results graph from ECMiner, displaying the main effect plot for average values across different categories. The plot compares various factors' impact on a metric, with each color representing a different category, illustrating how these factors affect the outcome.\n\nHowever, if the levels of only a few factors can be determined, B and E should first be set to levels 1 for both factors. And for the remaining factors, the level is determined by considering economic and cost effectiveness.\n\nThe experimental plan is terminated after determining reproducibility at the optimally determined level through re-experimentation.\n\n6.1.3.4.2. 3- Level Design\n\n3-Level Design is a design used when there are three levels per factor.

This setup is used to optimize experimental conditions for a specific process.\n\nSince the current characteristic value represents the content of impurities, a smaller value indicates better performance. So, select the mesh feature and start the analysis. The analysis of variance table based on the SN ratio shows that B's SS (Sum of Square) is extremely small. From this, we can see that factors A, C, and D all well explain the variance in SN ratio.\n\nFor detailed explanation, see 6.1.4. See Settings and Analysis.\n\nStep 5: Plot and Response Optimizer\n\n[image:rId135]\n\n[Image:rId135] The image shows an output results graph from ECMiner, displaying the main effect plot for average values across different treatment methods. The graph compares various treatments on a scale from 1 to 3, with each method represented by a different colored line. The x-axis indicates the treatment method, while the y-axis represents the\n\nIn this step, the optimal experimental conditions can be found through the main effects plot for the SN ratio. Currently, the SN ratio is the highest for A at level 2, B at level 3, C at level 3, and D at level 3, so A1, B2, C1, and D1 are the best conditions, assuming there is no interaction between A, B, and C. We conduct a confirmation experiment to confirm reproducibility and complete the experiment.\n\n6.1.3.4.3. 4 - Level Design, 5- Level Design, Mix-Level Design\n\nThe analysis method of all Taguchi Designs is the same as 2 and 3-Level Design. Therefore, we will only mention the characteristics of 4-Level Design, 5-Level Design, and Mix-Level Design.\n\nA 4-Level Design is a design in which the number of factor levels is 4.\n\n5- Level Design\n\nA 5-Level Design is a design in which the number of factor levels is 5.\n\nMix-Level Design\n\nMix - Level Design is a design where the number of levels of a factor varies depending on the factor.

Dispersion Analysis (Analysis of Variance, ANOVA)\n\nAnalysis of Variance allows you to determine whether each term affects the response value by determining the degree of variance caused by each term in the total variance. Distributed Analysis can be easily performed through the Regressor Matrix used in regression analysis.\nFirst, if there is a block, we need to find the variance for the block.\nIf we call the Submatrix consist of Regressor Matrix X's first to ith Column as, and w hen the total number of blocks is bn (>=2) it is X i\n\nSum of squares of block= y T X bn X bn T X bn -1 X bn T -X1 X1 T X1 -1 X1 T y\n\nIf the number of blocks is 1, the above process is not executed. And the degree of freedom at this time is bn-1.\nNow we need to find the Sum of Squares for each term. One term corresponds to one column of X. If a term corresponds to the jth column, the sum of square of that term is\n\ny T X i X i T X i -1 X i -X i-1 X i-1 T X i-1 -1 X i-1 y\n\nAt this time, the degree of freedom of this term is 1. However, ECMiner™ DOE does not calculate the Sum of Square for each term, but instead calculates the Sum of Square by grouping it by the main effect, two-way interaction, three-way interaction, or other characteristics. First, if the columns due to the main effect are from i to j, use the\n\ny T X j X j T X j -1 X j -X i-1 X i-1 T X i-1 -1 X i-1 y\n\nformula to find the Sum of Square. This is ultimately equal to the sum of the Sum of Squares for each column that makes up the main effect. Its degrees of freedom are i -j. In the same way, k-way interactions are also grouped to obtain the Sum of Square.\nIf there is a center point in the design, the last column corresponds to it. The variation about the center point is called Curvature. When the number of columns of X is Ncols, it is\n\nSum of Squares of Curvature= y T X Ncols X Ncols T X Ncols -1 X Ncols T -X Ncols-1 X Ncols-1 T X Ncols-1 -1 X Ncols-1 y\n\nand the degree of freedom is 1.\nIn the case of SSE and SST, they are obtained as follows.\n\nSSE=SST- Sum of Squares of all items.\n\nSST= i=1 n y i -y2\n\nThe degree of freedom at this time is ‘total number of data – 1’. Blocks, Curvature, main effects, two-way interaction. The F value and P value of are obtained through\n\nF-value= SS/df SST/(n-1) p-value=P F>Fvalue where F~F(df,n-1)\n\nAnother thing to consider is Lack of Fit. When we calculate SSE, it can be said that SSE consists of Pure Error and Lack of Fit. Pure Error can be obtained when experiments are conducted on the same point with multiple times (twice or more).\n(However, the same point here does not mean the actual same point. Here, the same point is said if the rows of the Regressor Matrix are the same. Even if the actual experimental points are different, the rows of the Regressor Matrix may be the same depending on how the selection term is selected.)\nIf ak (1<=k<=m) experiment point (when Nk experiments are performed) Pure Error is\n\nPure Error= k=1 m SST at a k\n\nwhere SST at a k = i∈A y i2 -N a k * i∈A y i N a k2 The set A consists of the rows of a k\n\nAnd the degrees of freedom of Pure Error are:\n\nDF of Pure Error= k=1 m (N a k -1)\n\nIf the Pure Error and its degrees of freedom are obtained in this way, the SS and degrees of freedom of the Lack of Fit can also be obtained as follows.\n\nSum of Squares of Lack of Fit'=SSE-Pure Error\n\nDF of Lack of Fit=DF of SSE-DF of Pure Error\n\nAt this time, the F value and P value of Lack of Fit obtained are\n\nFvalue= SS of Lack of Fit DF of Lack of Fit Pure Error DF of Pure Error and\n\np-value=P F>Fvalue where F~F(DF of Lack of Fit, DF of Pure Error)\n\nThrough this, you can statistically check whether there is a lack of suitability of this model.",

Using the main effects plot, you can intuitively understand what the response value or the fitted value in a regression model is at a specific level. In factorial design, you can select the data mean (using the response value directly) or the fitted mean (using the fitted value from the Regression Model), and in the design with Process Variable added in Mixture Design, only the data mean can be used.\n[image:rId129]\n\n6.1.4.3.2. Interaction Plot\n\nThis is a plot to display the interaction of two factors, such as AB and BC. For example, if factor A can have -1,1 and factor B can have -1,1 the average of the response values (or fitted values) of all experiments when factor A is -1 and B is -1, and the average of the response values (or fitted values) of all experiments when factor A is -1 and factor B is 1. Then draw one line. When factor A is 1 and factor B is -1 another line is drawn by connecting the average of the response values of all experiments and the average of the response values (or fitted values) of all experiments when factor A is 1 and factor B is 1. If we draw this on one screen, we can see the interaction of the ABs.

This is because meaningful results can be obtained with just this regression model. To add a little more, residual analysis, analysis fo r variance, etc. are performed to determine the significance of the regression model. This somewhat concludes the DOE's process.\nHowever, for user convenience and ease of interpretation, a plot can be drawn to express the results more visually and intuitively. For this purpose, in case of factorial design, main effects plot, interaction plot, surface plot, and contour plot are provided, and in case of response surface design, surface plot and contour plot are provided. In the case of Mixture Design, surface plots and contour plots are provided, and when Process Variable is added, main effect plots and interaction plots for process variables are provided.\nHowever, the final step of DOE can be said to be the response optimizer. Response optimizer is not simply aimed at maximizing or maximizing the response value of a regression model. Of course, this partial purpose can be fully achieved by adjusting various input values. Response optimizer, as DOE calls it, is a useful tool for meeting more general purposes. For example, if there are two or more response values in an experiment and you want to make one response value larger and one response value smaller, this can be solved by creating a new function and addressing the problem of increasing this function. Of course, this function will grow when the first response value is large, and it will grow when the second response value is small. After this, we will explain how to mathematically formalize this to reach the goal.\n\n6.1.4.4.1. Desirability Function\n\nThere is one desirability function for one reaction column. If there is only one reaction column, you need to find a combination of the levels of factors that optimize this one desirability function. If there are multiple reaction heats and you want to find the optimal factor level combination considering all multiple reaction heats, you can create a single overall desirability function that considers multiple desirability functions and optimize it.

This is because the initial values can determine whether the algorithm finds a local optimum or a global optimum. ECMinerTM DOE provides the selection methods of factorial design, response surface design, starting from a grid point, starting from a random point, and starting from a user-defined point, and Mixture Design provides a method that starts with a random point selection.\n\nBeta\n\nDue to the nature of the algorithm, Overall Desirability obtained from multiple points is stored, and the convergence condition is that the maximum difference between Overall Desirability obtained from multiple points must be smaller than Beta. Therefore, for users who want a more accurate value, the desired goal can be achieved by making this Beta value minimal.\n\nDelta\n\nDelta is a measure that determines how far a point should be brought back into the restricted area when it goes out of the restricted area. However, empirically, the measure does not have a decisive effect on the performance of the algorithm.\n\nInitial Value Quantity: It is a decision to perform the algorithm on a number of different initial values.\n\nMax Repetition Count\n\nIt determines the maximum number of times to repeat the algorithm.
