This design can be used when the user has prior knowledge that the only one factor the response value is the main effect. This prior knowledge helps to dramatically reduce the number of experiments.\nPlackett-Burman design has similar post-analysis steps to 2-Level Factorial Design. Therefore, we will mainly explain the differences compared to 2-Level Factorial Design.\nThe characteristic of Plackett-Burman is that it dramatically reduces the number of experiments when the experimenter knows in advance that there is only a linear relationship between factors and response values. For example, the main effect can be detected with just 48 experiments for 47 factors. The reason we use the Plackett-Burman design is that it can dramatically reduce the need for experimentation.\nSelect Plackett-Burman design and select 20 factors on the Step 1 screen. Step 2 Afterwards, if you move to the Step 2 screen, you can select the following number of experiments.\n[image:rId40]\nIf the experimenter aims to minimize the number of experiments, a design with 24 runs can be selected. The maximum number of runs can be selected up to 48, but 48 experiments for 20 is not particularly burdensome. Set the number of runs and the number of center points and repetition according to your purpose. Center point is used to check curvature, and by increasing repetition, pure error can be checked how much the difference in response value occurs at the same experimental point.\nIn Step 3, the design table is completed, and in Step 4, the following screen appears.\n[image:rId41]\nIn the Plackett-Burman design, interactions other than the main effect cannot be detected.

And the reason why the target value of adhesion was set as large as possible is because in the case of adhesion, the larger the better. (In fact, it seems reasonable to set the lower limit of modulus and elongation to 145 and 388. However, in this case, if the modulus value is less than 145 or the elongation value is less than 388, the desirability function becomes 0. In fact, this area is so large that it is often difficult to find the optimal value when performing optimization. For this purpose, the performance of optimization was improved by setting the lower limit a little smaller.)\n\nAfter configuring this and performing optimization, you can get the following results.\n\n[image:rId79]",

Box-Behnken Design\n\nBox Behnken's design was created to complement the shortcomings of 2-Level design and 3-Level design. In general, p-level designs are suitable for polynomial fits of order p-1. Therefore, it is difficult to fit a second order polynomial with a 2-level design, and although it is possible with a 3-level design, it has the disadvantage of requiring a large number of experiments. Box Behnken's design is an experiment that selects a part of the 3-level design and allows for more efficient second order polynomial fit.\nBox Behnken design is also a design created for the same purpose as central composite design. Therefore, rather than explaining this in detail with an example, we will explain the differences in central composite design.

Simplex Lattice Design\n\nIf the goal is to conduct an experiment in a simplex region and create a regression model based on the experiment results, it would be desirable for the experiment points to be evenly distributed throughout the simplex region. The design that meets this purpose is Simplex Lattice Design. Simplex Lattice Design is a useful design for fitting m-order polynomials when there are n components.\nThrough Simplex Lattice Design, we will explain mixture volume design. First, select Simplex Lattice Design.\n[image:rId98]\n\n[Table:t445]",

Since this experiment is a mixture amount design, multiple total amounts are selected rather than a single total. If you think the quantity will have a quadratic or greater impact on the response value, experiment with three or more positive values. If you are sure that the quantity will have a linear effect on the response value, two quantity values are sufficient. This requires careful consideration because the smaller the number of positive values, the fewer the number of experiments.\n\nHowever, as a result of the analysis of the first experiment conducted in this way, if it is confirmed that the effect of the amount of mixture is quadratic or higher, there is no need to perform the experiment perfectly from the beginning, as you only need to do a few additional experiments.

Dispersion Analysis (Analysis of Variance, ANOVA)\n\nAnalysis of Variance allows you to determine whether each term affects the response value by determining the degree of variance caused by each term in the total variance. Distributed Analysis can be easily performed through the Regressor Matrix used in regression analysis.\nFirst, if there is a block, we need to find the variance for the block.\nIf we call the Submatrix consist of Regressor Matrix X's first to ith Column as, and w hen the total number of blocks is bn (>=2) it is X i\n\nSum of squares of block= y T X bn X bn T X bn -1 X bn T -X1 X1 T X1 -1 X1 T y\n\nIf the number of blocks is 1, the above process is not executed. And the degree of freedom at this time is bn-1.\nNow we need to find the Sum of Squares for each term. One term corresponds to one column of X. If a term corresponds to the jth column, the sum of square of that term is\n\ny T X i X i T X i -1 X i -X i-1 X i-1 T X i-1 -1 X i-1 y\n\nAt this time, the degree of freedom of this term is 1. However, ECMiner™ DOE does not calculate the Sum of Square for each term, but instead calculates the Sum of Square by grouping it by the main effect, two-way interaction, three-way interaction, or other characteristics. First, if the columns due to the main effect are from i to j, use the\n\ny T X j X j T X j -1 X j -X i-1 X i-1 T X i-1 -1 X i-1 y\n\nformula to find the Sum of Square. This is ultimately equal to the sum of the Sum of Squares for each column that makes up the main effect. Its degrees of freedom are i -j. In the same way, k-way interactions are also grouped to obtain the Sum of Square.\nIf there is a center point in the design, the last column corresponds to it. The variation about the center point is called Curvature. When the number of columns of X is Ncols, it is\n\nSum of Squares of Curvature= y T X Ncols X Ncols T X Ncols -1 X Ncols T -X Ncols-1 X Ncols-1 T X Ncols-1 -1 X Ncols-1 y\n\nand the degree of freedom is 1.\nIn the case of SSE and SST, they are obtained as follows.\n\nSSE=SST- Sum of Squares of all items.\n\nSST= i=1 n y i -y2\n\nThe degree of freedom at this time is ‘total number of data – 1’. Blocks, Curvature, main effects, two-way interaction. The F value and P value of are obtained through\n\nF-value= SS/df SST/(n-1) p-value=P F>Fvalue where F~F(df,n-1)\n\nAnother thing to consider is Lack of Fit. When we calculate SSE, it can be said that SSE consists of Pure Error and Lack of Fit. Pure Error can be obtained when experiments are conducted on the same point with multiple times (twice or more).\n(However, the same point here does not mean the actual same point. Here, the same point is said if the rows of the Regressor Matrix are the same. Even if the actual experimental points are different, the rows of the Regressor Matrix may be the same depending on how the selection term is selected.)\nIf ak (1<=k<=m) experiment point (when Nk experiments are performed) Pure Error is\n\nPure Error= k=1 m SST at a k\n\nwhere SST at a k = i∈A y i2 -N a k * i∈A y i N a k2 The set A consists of the rows of a k\n\nAnd the degrees of freedom of Pure Error are:\n\nDF of Pure Error= k=1 m (N a k -1)\n\nIf the Pure Error and its degrees of freedom are obtained in this way, the SS and degrees of freedom of the Lack of Fit can also be obtained as follows.\n\nSum of Squares of Lack of Fit'=SSE-Pure Error\n\nDF of Lack of Fit=DF of SSE-DF of Pure Error\n\nAt this time, the F value and P value of Lack of Fit obtained are\n\nFvalue= SS of Lack of Fit DF of Lack of Fit Pure Error DF of Pure Error and\n\np-value=P F>Fvalue where F~F(DF of Lack of Fit, DF of Pure Error)\n\nThrough this, you can statistically check whether there is a lack of suitability of this model.",

This is because the initial values can determine whether the algorithm finds a local optimum or a global optimum. ECMinerTM DOE provides the selection methods of factorial design, response surface design, starting from a grid point, starting from a random point, and starting from a user-defined point, and Mixture Design provides a method that starts with a random point selection.\n\nBeta\n\nDue to the nature of the algorithm, Overall Desirability obtained from multiple points is stored, and the convergence condition is that the maximum difference between Overall Desirability obtained from multiple points must be smaller than Beta. Therefore, for users who want a more accurate value, the desired goal can be achieved by making this Beta value minimal.\n\nDelta\n\nDelta is a measure that determines how far a point should be brought back into the restricted area when it goes out of the restricted area. However, empirically, the measure does not have a decisive effect on the performance of the algorithm.\n\nInitial Value Quantity: It is a decision to perform the algorithm on a number of different initial values.\n\nMax Repetition Count\n\nIt determines the maximum number of times to repeat the algorithm.
