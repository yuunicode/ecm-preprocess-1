The innovative aspect of this methodology is to modify the assumption that random shocks have constant variance in the time series analysis so far, and introduce the assumption that random shocks have constant variance unconditionally, but the conditional variance depend on time t. Robert Engle proposed the ARCH Model in 1982, and the generalized ARCH model, that is, the GARCH model, was proposed by Bollerslev in 1986 and various modified models such as EGARCH, GARCH-M, and GJR have been presented since then. The reason why many modified models of ARCH have been presented and received a lot of attention is because with the development of financial economics, not only time series prediction but also measurement and prediction of volatility (variance) have become very important. In many capital asset pricing models, the volatility of the underlying asset has been considered an important factor affecting the price of the asset, but the methodology for measuring and predicting this volatility had not been developed before ARCH. Research related to this has continued steadily not only in the 1980s, but also since then, and even recently, the GARCH model is now used in various engineering fields, especially network traffic analysis, in addition to financial economics.",
